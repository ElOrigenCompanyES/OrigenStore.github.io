# Installation

### Step 1 - Start Order

In order for the resource to start correctly and not receive any errors, we must start the resources in the following order

```cfg {3} showLineNumbers filename="server.cfg"
ensure qb-core
...
ensure origen_races
```

### Step 2 - Setup SQL

For the resource to work correctly, you need to import the SQL file into your database. You can find this file in the ```origen_races/races.sql``` folder of the resource.


### Step 3 - Setup Config
 
In order for the script to function properly, you must change the Config.Framework setting to your framework in this case it will be "qb-core". Feel free to make any other necessary changes as well.

```lua {4-5, 6-7} showLineNumbers filename="config.lua"

Config = {}

Config.Framework = "qbcore" -- qbcore or esx [Default: qbcore] (Select the framework)


```
